During my time as a personal assistant to Yanis Varoufakis I collected information of the economics power that rule the world.

Dr Levi Hopkins (Lev)


One day before a state meeting, I receive a brief about how to improve the greek economy. In that brief, there was a list of the most significant investments in 2010. 
One of the biggest one was from Microsoft into mining congo.
Next to it, it was a transfer from the Bill and Melinda Fundation.
