      <description>During my time as a personal assistant to Yanis Varoufakis I collected information on the economic power that rules the world.
One day before a state meeting, I receive a brief about how to improve the greek economy. In that brief, there was a list of the most significant mining investments in 2010.
Tech companies were the biggest ones, and all of them had an interest in the congo. Most of these companies already stop mining there because of all the constant child abuse common in those countries.</description>
